For my zoom background I have two seperate ideas, both very tempting. The first idea is to have a video of a burglar going into my room and doing his best to be sneaky as he robs
possessions from my rooms. The second idea is have a lego stop-motion video playing in the bakground, making it seem as if im in a small lego room. There is going to be lego figures 
moving around and they would also be building stuff and breaking walls. The second idea would be the funniest in my opinion.
