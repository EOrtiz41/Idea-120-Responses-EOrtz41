I've always liked Fantasy role-playing games like DnD, Final Fantasy, Skyrim, and even a bit of Pitfall, where making decisions really do matter. So I want to make a non-linear
narrative that has a fantasy setting. I'm thinking of a person escaping a prison fighting a bunch of magical creatures and surviving in the wilderness against the magical elements.
I think it'd be interesting and it'd open up alot of oppurtunity for making something unique and just seems like it'd be an overall breeze to come up with content for this. Throw
in a troll here, a lava spider there, and maybe even a demented witch, stuff like that. The main character would be a brittle brick golem who has the ability to use magic, I think it's 
remarkably simple but I've got a feeling this'll be cool. There will be side characters such as the Marshall, other Convicts, and a Forest wanderer. Really hyped for this.
