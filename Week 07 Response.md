I completely agree with James Bridle on the issues at hand with the internet and how dark it has gotten over the years. Thanks to the internet, we've had Dark things be created
such as SCP's and Creepy Pastas, scary myths and creatures made famous by the internet, and created by the internet. There are extremely horrid places in the internet, such as the
Dark Web, a section of the internet that is hard to reach and contains gruesome and illegal activities. To read James Bridles talk on him touching upon how the internet is negatively
affecting children is only a scratch on the surface. James Bridle even says himself in the article that there are much worse content available on the internet. 

I do also think Bridle's vision of the internet has good intentions, but at the same time it's impossible to be able to control a thing such as the internet. The internet is a 
digital world,  and to treat it as a world would also give it the fact that it cannot be completely controlled just as Earth is not entirely controlled either, because it's 
impossible with the infinite amounts of information that are added onto in godly amounts every second of the day.
