I never knew that the Mandalorian was filmed using 360-degree LED screens or that 360-degree LED screens even existed like that, especially for the use of film-making. Janet Murray claims that the Internet and Constantly-Improving Computer Software have begun or will soon bridge the gap between standard entertainment and the online world, making them one. For example, movies being on the internet and being able to be viewed, websites made by news outlets to help them gain coverage and views, and much more. Mandalorian is somewhat connected to this in the aspect that digital software is spilling over into the film industry more and more as time continues. Back then we were limited to filming at actual locations, creating sets, and backgrounds projected onto screens with projectors. Later on, green screen was used more and more and begun to limit the founding elements that made a film in the beginning. We no longer had to be on-location, create sets, or create practical costumes when they can be digitally constructed and projected onto a screen. A great example of the peak of Green Screen was Avengers: Endgame, which relied heavily on green screen and was a major success. Now the new age is the 360-degree LED screen, which is an improved method than that of the green screen. How Mandalorian uses this relatively new tool is connected to Murray's theory in that Digital Software is becoming a larger and larger component of the Film-making business that may one day become a necessity with the ease of  it provides in filmmaking.
