Chalabi's TED talk put data collection in multiple different perspectives. The first perspective she presented was how the physical appearance of data can affect the probability
of people believing the information they are taking in. She provides multiple examples, one being a chart of the number females in France being fined for wearing hijabs over the 
years being represented in a drawing that resembled a woman wearing a hijab. It appeals to the eye more and she was right, it does make you less skeptical of what you're seeing.
I'm just like your normal everyday citizen and when she talked about how a significant portion of us are skeptical of the information we take in, I couldn't help but feel I was part
of the portion that didn't challenge what I was seeing. Sure I doubted it, but at the same time, I still took it in. With everything she's said I now know I should scan the data I 
see more closely, and be mindful of who is publishing it.

Meanwhile, Cathy O' Neil presents more information in another chapter of her work. As she pointed out the different ways that data is collected and used in the Business Industries
of the world, I thought about the ways I already knew my data was being used. One method I heard of was how the "Facebook" app listens to what you're saying and presents Ads based on
what they've heard. I've seen this first hand as I grew suspicious of the Advertisements I saw after a recent conversation about the same thing. Another method I have definitely 
felt to have been exposed to is how advertisments from Colleges target specific audiences that are easier to be taken advantage of by convincing them to fall into their scheme
of for-profit tuition. One such example was the "Corinthian College" scandal O' Neil speaks about in her writing. It targeted vulnerable women who had what they categorized "No Future"
because they felt they were the audience most-likely to give in and throw them their money. When I was applying for Colleges, I looked at all the advertisements Universities were 
sending me and the ads I saw on the internet I visited and thought "It sounds really nice." But as soon as I looked at their tuition prices my jaws dropped, and I knew they were
trying to come off as friendly and inspiring just to get what you have in your pocket.
