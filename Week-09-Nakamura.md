When Nakamura quotes Lev Manovich by writing "interactive media asks us to identify with someone else's mental structure" she puts out a piece of information that serves to 
bring a depthness to her own work, as there is a deep meaning to this. First and foremost, in analyzing this quote, one of the obvious interpretations and/or meanings of this 
line is that when we access a digital tool or product such as gmail, faecbook, or snapchat, we are in a way, experiencing the creator's thought processes and visions as well as 
their very own preferences. There is a reason each digital product and tool are unique to themselves in the services and sensations they provide. Gmail is known for professional
connecting while Facebook is known as a fun social network that has easy accessiblity and use for everyone, even children. From this, we can get a feel of who the person (the creator)
and their viewpoints. Gmail might've been created by an innovative person who believes there must be a network that exists mainly to connect professionals, businesses, and 
communities in a formal way.

We are somehow experiencing each person's "mental structure" because as the principalities of creation goes, the creator always puts a piece of themselves into what they make. 
Wether it be experiences, dreams, visions, mentalities, and personality, there is always a piece of them placed into it. Tiktok for example, may have been created with the purpose
of helping people become well-known through entertainment, which is why it's known for the incountable dances, jokes, and funny random footage it puts for its viewers to watch. From
this, we can say the creator must've been a person who believed in showing their own talent for everyone to see and most likely is a very social person who believes no one should be
afraid of their own talents and abilities. Another example, can be snapchat, which in different ways is similar but focusses on giving its users fun experiences with their numerous 
filters, and being able to share these funny experiences with their friends and family as well as keeping a general connection with them. So it can be said the creator of Snapchat is
a person who believes in having fun experiences and that sharing them with others can make everything all the better for everyone. Perhaps I'm only scratching the surfaces of their
identities, there might be deeper displays of who they are, but we can generally know how they feel about what their creation does, because why else would they make it in the first place?
