explain in about 1 paragraph what content you'll include in your portfolio and how it will be organized.

In my portfolio, I'll be showing my Flarf Poem, my Brick Golem videogame (which hasn't been made yet), and the video of my zoom background from Guitar Hero : Legends of Rock. 
I think these would all be good to present. The Flarf Poem would be shown on its own webpage, and the Brick Golem videogame (if applicable) I would hope to put it on a webpage
and be directly played from there, but I'm not sure I have the knowledge and experience to do that, so I'll have a link to it with pictures of the game around the link and 
a breif summary of the game under it. My next project would be shown as a video that can be watched of the Zoom background in action. All of the projects will have information 
written next to them explaining what they are and offering some background to them as well. They will all have their own seperate webpages with a "next" or "before" button on the
bottom of each webpage to go across the different projects in my portfolio.
