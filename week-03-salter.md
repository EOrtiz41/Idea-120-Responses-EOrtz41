# How to Gesamtkunstwerk

That very long german word at first was something completely unknown to me until I read the first few pages of the reading and continued on with it. A general definition of it would be an artwork consisting of multiple different medias intertwining and working together to create one thing. The example used in the reading was the "Theatre of Illusion" by Richard Wagner where his opera "The Ring was performed in. In this real-life historic example Wagner's theatre was constructed soley for his opera and used several different medias such as lighting techniques, aesthetic architecture, architecture that interacted with the sound of the instruments, artwork, and many other things. 

Nowadays, the ablity to make a Gesamtkunstwerk is easier than ever. With the avilable technology such as electrical lighting, CGI, advances in machinery, recorded audio, television screens, and speakers can all contribute to this. The most common form of Gesamtkunstwerk lies in architecture where bulldings use certified standards in construction and also artistic presentation  through the implementation of drawn and digitalzed blueprints, statues, paintings, specific colors in furniture and more, it's something that accomplishes this with sometimes little thought to the idea that there is an implementation of many different medias to make this one whole art.  As art is subjective, I can say the experience and emotions provided by a location by using multiple senses of our five sense can be something to consider. Therefore, the experience of eating at a Portillos, in a way could be considered Gesamtkunstwerk.
