When I read O'Neil's article about "WMD"- that is "Weapons of Math Destruction"- it really opened my mind to how mathematicians and computer coders alike have the ability to impair someone's life through means of digital coding. It was really fascinating and somewhat scary to think about in all honesty. With all the significant gains I knew computer programming did, I didn't much consider that it had just of equal opportunity and power to negatively affect people's lives.

One "WMD" I feel is significant in today's world is "Amazon" the famous online store. Its mere existence hurts local stores by encouraging people to shop online rather than in-person at the local businesses that have more heart and depend on the profits from their goods to continue their lives. It's understandable that people shop online now during the pandemic, but for the previous statement I'm taking into consideration the general impact Amazon has had well before the pandemic. Now considering the pandemic, the creator of Amazon wallows in a near whopping $203 billion dollars of net worth and had an increase $90 billion dollars during the entire pandemic, all the while many local vendors have run out of business and eventually shut down. 

 These businesses attempted to adapt to these new circumstances for the pandemic by setting their efforts to online vending. Many still struggle to this day due to the existence of the widely-known online shopping website, Amazon. Amazon presents a great deal of options to buy and helps to support the larger companies to sell their goods. They also allow local vendors to sell their merchandise and goods there as well but there is a payment required to use the service which some can't even afford to begin with. As effective Amazon is at making profit, it makes the sustaining of local businesses slightly more difficult.
