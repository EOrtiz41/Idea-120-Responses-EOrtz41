The final product of a videogame is a physical manifestation of the thoughts and voices of the people who created it. Having more voices within the creation can allow the 
game to represent a wider audience, and thus, appeal to a wider audience as well. While the opinions and biased views on different people (who are not so different after all) 
are beginning to be lifted and turning into feelings of acceptance towards people of different color, sex, and identity, there was and still is the problem that these 
voices that have been deemed 'different' by large groups are not able to have a voice at all. There are numerous ways of having their voices heard, but one such way I'll be 
talking about is through the creation of videogames, which has a very large user base surrounding it. 

Not only would having more voices allow videogames to appeal to a wider audience, it would offer views, content, information, that reveal new things about what there is to 
know and experience. For example, a relatively new game, "Sekiro : Shadows Die Twice" raised awareness about japanese culture and showed insight into religions such as buddhism
as well as offering a look into the natural landscapes found within Japan. This game gained a large fan-base and was extremely successful and was so successful, fans of the game
helped rebuild a monument that was shown in the game, but damaged in real life. This monument was the Watatsumi Shrine, and was damaged by a typhoon in September of 2020. Many fans
donated, helping the crowdfuning campaign acheive 500 percent of its original goal, and successfully being able to restore the shrine.

Videogames have the potential to increase congitive-thinking, relieve stress, and much more. Sandbox games such as Minecraft, Garrys Mod, and Roblox allow a player to create 
whatever they want. Depending on the game, the limits of what the player wants to create are completely limitless. In Minecraft, playes have created complex and detailed statues.
Garrys Mod allows players to create complex and interactive environments. Roblox allows players to create whatever fun activities they like for others. While games are seen as 
being able to make someone more violent, I can personally say they don't. While killing someone in a videogame seems like an unsettling activity for someone to be doing, in reality
the player knows its a game and that noone is actually dying, and would not go around in real life acting like its GTA, because well, we have emotions and morals that 
actually tell us not to actually hurt someone. 

Games have been known by many to be a stress-reducer, the games that reduce stress for a player vary from each individual as every person has their own preference for the video
games they like playing. Someone might feel at peace playing Call of Duty while someone else would feel at peace playing Animal Crossing. From my personal experience, playing video
games (especially with my brothers and freinds) has always been fun and also a great way of blowing off steam from a long day. Sometimes, it really is nice to come back from work
or school, sit down,turn on the game system, and put on some God of War.
