Would a game be considered a game if there were so many rules that the experience would be the exact same regardless of the individual who plays it? Can another person themself 
constitute as a rule? Is it still considered a game if it can't be beaten or finished? 

How can another person themself constitute as a rule? Taking into consideration how "Tag" has two seperate types of players such as the "Runner" and the "Chaser", the 
obvious rules such as having to not be tagged by the Chaser and the Chaser having to tag everyone in the game are not the only rules, and I feel they aren't mentioned. This rule 
would be in the players themselves and the actions they take when they play the game. In doing this, the person who has done an action has just set "rules" for the responder to
abide by.

For example, when a Chaser holds their arms across an exit way, it is restricting the Runner's options and in a way, giving them rules they have created to abide by. The rule in 
this specific scenario would be that the Runner cannot directly go through that exitway or else he/she would be tagged. Unless the Runner is a madman and actually wants to be 
tagged, then this rules is no longer there but we're taking into perspective a normal game of Tag. From there, the Runner would input these rules the Chaser has made ontop of the 
set rules of the game, and make a decision. They can take a different exitway, run at the Chaser and flip over them, etc. 

In a different game such as Chess, the rules are for more complex and so are the possiblities. The limitations of these rules are very very light at the beginning with the player
being able to move most pieces where they want. The rules that a player sets on another are in a way, subject to opinion here. This is because if Player 1 had his King one space
away and in front of Player 2's King, the rule set by Player 2 would be that Player 1 would not be able to move their King one space forward in front of Player 2's King because
that would allow his King to be defeated by Player 2's king and thus, defeated. However, Player 1 DOES move his King forward and offers Player 2 $100 if he lets him win. Player 2 
thinks of it and skips his own turn, letting Player 1 win. A hefty bill is slid under the table.T here are these invisible rules not mentioned in the games because these rules are 
limitless and complex because they are rules created by the human mind, capable of complex thinking and incapable of being brought up in a list of possibilities as there are too 
many to keep account of. Within Multi-player games, the each player sets rules for the other player to accomdate as it affects their next decision. I feel, this is vague yet can
be grasped with some thought, at least hopefully.
